Despite the success, the potential misuse of T2I models poses significant risks of generating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. To investigate the vulnerability of T2I models, this paper delves into adversarial attacks to bypass the safety mechanisms under black-box settings. Most previous methods rely on word substitution to search adversarial prompts. Due to limited search space, this leads to suboptimal performance compared to gradient-based training. However, black-box settings present unique challenges to training gradient-driven attack methods, since there is no access to the internal architecture and parameters of T2I models. To facilitate the learning of adversarial prompts in black-box settings, we propose a novel prompt learning attack framework (PLA), where insightful gradient-based training tailored to black-box T2I models is designed by utilizing multimodal similarities. Experiments show that our new method can effectively attack the safety mechanisms of black-box T2I models including prompt filters and post-hoc safety checkers with a high success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Despite its advantages, developing VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to the time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging instructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two core components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the text, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated demonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module receives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information. Based on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant data from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by changing the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate tasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development overhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving industrial needs.", "comments": "7 pages, 7 figures, conference", "project_url": ""}

To examine this threat, we present the first systematic study on inversion attacks targeting LLM empowered recommender systems, where adversaries attempt to reconstruct original prompts that contain personal preferences, interaction histories, and demographic attributes by exploiting the output logits of recommendation models. We reproduce the vec2text framework and optimize it using our proposed method called Similarity Guided Refinement, enabling more accurate reconstruction of textual prompts from model generated logits.

We expand on that research by conducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded representational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of identity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about significant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to encourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious and caste representation in the outputs against the actual population distribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and \"stickiness\" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We find that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups far beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to encourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that representational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased than the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated prompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these biases.

Although a preliminary investigation examined involuntary eye movements and perceived maneuverability under two distinct machine dynamics with preserved SoA, it remains unclear how systematic variations in motion dynamics influence these factors. Therefore, the purpose of the present research was to investigate whether systematic variations in the dynamic properties of a ride-on machine, where the perceived maneuverability is modulated, influence the accuracy of involuntary eye movements in human operators. Participants rode a yaw-rotational platform whose time constant from joystick input to motor torque of a rotational machine was systematically manipulated. During the operation, eye movements were recorded while participants fixated on a visual target. After each condition, participants provided subjective ratings of maneuverability and cognitive load. As the platform's time constant increased, the perceived maneuverability scores decreased while the cognitive loads increased. Concurrently, involuntary eye movement accuracy decreased.

This study proposes two innovative approaches to enhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion factor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the conversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter (mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly estimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The experimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses. Tests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show that measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were reduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods.

However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract diagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling remain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings. In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our findings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry labeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel framework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for structured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning approach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks: perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin, and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage framework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint diagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on real-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical scenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with 8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and 4470 synthetically generated samples.

This leads to challenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse rewards, and frequent hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose CX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved \"think-answer\" reasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and verifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an instruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148 samples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points supervised by clinical reports.

The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring robustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized (VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook updates.

In Stage-1, we build the Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907 locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability difference reward involved strategy for \"think\" process supervision. The resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust \"think\" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset of texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the LLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including performing post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made, state-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation cost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a single response-context pair.

Existing inverse game-theoretic approaches frame this challenge in terms of a \"level-1\" inference problem, in which we take the perspective of a third-party observer and assume that individual agents share complete knowledge of one another's objectives. However, this assumption breaks down in decentralized, real-world decision scenarios like urban driving and bargaining, in which agents may act based on conflicting views of one another's objectives. We demonstrate the necessity of inferring agents' heterogeneous estimates of each other's objectives through empirical examples, and by theoretically characterizing the prediction error of level-1 inference on fictitious gameplay data from linear-quadratic games. To address this fundamental issue, we propose a framework for level-2 inference to address the question: \"What does each agent believe about all agents' objectives?\" We prove that the level-2 inference problem is non-convex even in benign settings like linear-quadratic games, and we develop an efficient gradient-based approach for identifying local solutions. Experiments on a synthetic urban driving example show that our approach uncovers nuanced misalignments that level-1 methods miss.", "comments": "7 pages + references + appendix", "project_url": ""}

While classical results establish a rigorous framework in the case of distributions over finite domains, real-world applications in computational linguistics, bioinformatics, and program analysis demand testing over infinite combinatorial structures, particularly strings. In this paper, we initiate the theoretical study of identity testing for stochastic languages, bridging formal language theory with modern distribution property testing. We first propose a polynomial-time algorithm to verify if a finite state machine represents a stochastic language, and then prove that rational stochastic languages can approximate an arbitrary probability distribution. Building on these representations, we develop a truncation-based identity testing algorithm that distinguishes between a known and an unknown distributions with sample complexity $\\widetilde{\\Theta}\\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\varepsilon^2} + \\frac{n}{\\log n} \\right)$ where $n$ is the size of the truncated support.

While effective in low-dimensional settings, BO faces scalability challenges in high-dimensional spaces and with large number of function evaluations due to the computational complexity of GP models. In contrast, neural networks (NNs) offer better scalability and can model complex functions, which led to the development of NN-based BO approaches. However, these methods typically rely on estimating model uncertainty in NN prediction -- a process that is often computationally intensive and complex, particularly in high dimensions. To address these limitations, a novel method, called scalable neural network-based blackbox optimization (SNBO), is proposed that does not rely on model uncertainty estimation. Specifically, SNBO adds new samples using separate criteria for exploration and exploitation, while adaptively controlling the sampling region to ensure efficient optimization. SNBO is evaluated on a range of optimization problems spanning from 10 to 102 dimensions and compared against four state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Across the majority of test problems, SNBO attains function values better than the best-performing baseline algorithm, while requiring 40-60% fewer function evaluations and reducing the runtime by at least an order of magnitude.", "comments": "This preprint has been submitted to Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization for peer review.

To address this issue, watermarking techniques have emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages into generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent efforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich information such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the fundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure reliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token sets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated content. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that improves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects preferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a larger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that rely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a clustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even when the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and decoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the message into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically decode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text and improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and text generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines.", "comments": "Preprint", "project_url": ""}

A key difficulty is that dynamic code rarely follows datatype-driven design. Programs instead use runtime tests to narrow down the proper usage of incoming data. Type systems for dynamic languages thus need a **type narrowing** mechanism that refines the type environment along individual control paths based on dominating tests, a form of flow-sensitive typing. In order to express refinements, the type system must have some notion of sets and subsets. Since set-theoretic types are computationally and ergonomically complex, the need for type narrowing raises design questions about how to balance precision and performance. **Inquiry:** To date, the design of type narrowing systems has been driven by intuition, past experience, and examples from users in various language communities. There is no standard that captures desirable and undesirable behaviors. Prior formalizations of narrowing are also significantly more complex than a standard type system, and it is unclear how the extra complexity pays off in terms of concrete examples. This paper addresses the problems through If-T, a language-agnostic **design benchmark** for type narrowing that characterizes the abilities of implementations using simple programs that draw attention to fundamental questions. Unlike a traditional performance-focused benchmark, If-T measures a narrowing system's ability to validate correct code and reject incorrect code. Unlike a test suite, systems are not required to fully conform to If-T. Deviations are acceptable provided they are justified by well-reasoned design considerations, such as compile-time performance. **Approach:** If-T is guided by the literature on type narrowing, the documentation of gradual languages such as TypeScript, and experiments with typechecker implementations. We have identified a set of core technical dimensions for type narrowing. For each dimension, the benchmark contains a set of topics and (at least) two characterizing programs per topic: one that should typecheck and one that should not typecheck. **Knowledge:** If-T provides a baseline to measure type narrowing systems. For researchers, it provides criteria to categorize future designs via its collection of positive and negative examples. For language designers, the benchmark demonstrates the payoff of typechecker complexity in terms of concrete examples. Designers can use the examples to decide whether supporting a particular example is worthwhile. Both the benchmark and its implementations are freely available online. **Grounding:** We have implemented the benchmark for five typecheckers: TypeScript, Flow, Typed Racket, mypy, and Pyright. The results highlight important differences, such as the ability to track logical implications among program variables and typechecking for user-defined narrowing predicates. **Importance:** Type narrowing is essential for gradual type systems, but the tradeoffs between systems with different complexity have been unclear. If-T clarifies these tradeoffs by illustrating the benefits and limitations of each level of complexity. With If-T as a way to assess implementations in a fair, cross-language manner, future type system designs can strive for a better balance among precision, annotation burden, and performance.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

Compliance with these regulations requires systematically considering information flow and interactions among entities handling sensitive data. Privacy-by-design principles advocate embedding data protection into system architectures as a default. However, translating these abstract principles into concrete, explicit methods remains a significant challenge. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a language-based approach to privacy integration, combining static and runtime techniques. By employing type checking and type inference in an active object language, the framework enables the tracking of authorised data flows and the automatic generation of constraints checked at runtime based on user consent. This ensures that personal data is processed in compliance with GDPR constraints. The key contribution of this work is a type system that gather the compliance checks and the changes to users consent and integrates data privacy compliance verification into system execution. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of this approach through a soundness proof and several examples, illustrating how the proposed language addresses common GDPR requirements, such as user consent, purpose limitation, and data subject rights. This work advances the state of the art in privacy-aware system design by offering a systematic and automated method for integrating GDPR compliance into programming languages.

In addition to programming languages, which are analyzed by compilers or interpreters, there are numerous components that process standardized or proprietary data formats of varying complexity. Even if such components were initially developed and tested based on a specification, such as a grammar, numerous modifications and adaptations over the course of software evolution can make it impossible to precisely determine which inputs they actually accept. In this situation, grammar mining can be used to reconstruct the specification in the form of a grammar. Established approaches already produce useful results, provided that sufficient input data is available to fully cover the input language. However, achieving this completeness is a major challenge. In practice, only input data recorded during the operation of the software systems is available. If this data is used for grammar mining, the resulting grammar reflects only the actual processed inputs but not the complete grammar of the input language accepted by the software component. As a result, edge cases or previously supported features that no longer appear in the available input data are missing from the generated grammar. This work addresses this challenge by introducing a novel approach for the automatic generation of inputs for grammar mining. Although input generators have already been used for fuzz testing, it remains unclear whether they are also suitable for grammar miners. Building on the grammar miner Mimid, this work presents a fully automated approach to input generation. The approach leverages Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) and extends it with two mechanisms to overcome the limitations of DSE regarding structured input parsers. First, the search for new inputs is guided by an iterative expansion that starts with a single-character input and gradually extends it. Second, input generation is structured into a novel three-phase approach, which separates the generation of inputs for parser functions. The proposed method was evaluated against a diverse set of eleven benchmark applications from the existing literature. Results demonstrate that the approach achieves precision and recall for extracted grammars close to those derived from state-of-the-art grammar miners such as Mimid. Notably, it successfully uncovers subtle features and edge cases in parsers that are typically missed by such grammar miners. The effectiveness of the method is supported by empirical evidence, showing that it can achieve high performance in various domains without requiring prior input samples. This contribution is significant for researchers and practitioners in software engineering, offering an automated, scalable, and precise solution for grammar mining. By eliminating the need for manual input generation, the approach not only reduces workload but also enhances the robustness and comprehensiveness of the extracted grammars. Following this approach, software engineers can reconstruct specification from existing (legacy) parsers.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

As bandit algorithms are increasingly deployed in these socially sensitive settings, it becomes critical to protect user data privacy and ensure fair treatment across decision rounds. While prior work has independently addressed privacy and fairness in bandit settings, the question of whether both objectives can be achieved simultaneously has remained largely open. Existing privacy-preserving bandit algorithms typically optimize average regret, a utilitarian measure, whereas fairness-aware approaches focus on minimizing Nash regret, which penalizes inequitable reward distributions, but often disregard privacy concerns. To bridge this gap, we introduce Differentially Private Nash Confidence Bound (DP-NCB)-a novel and unified algorithmic framework that simultaneously ensures $\\epsilon$-differential privacy and achieves order-optimal Nash regret, matching known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. The framework is sufficiently general to operate under both global and local differential privacy models, and is anytime, requiring no prior knowledge of the time horizon. We support our theoretical guarantees with simulations on synthetic bandit instances, showing that DP-NCB incurs substantially lower Nash regret than state-of-the-art baselines. Our results offer a principled foundation for designing bandit algorithms that are both privacy-preserving and fair, making them suitable for high-stakes, socially impactful applications.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

Like several other surrogate and operator learning models, the proposed approach employs an encoder to reduce the high-dimensional input $y(\\bm{x})$ to a lower-dimensional latent space, $\\bm\\mu_{\\bm\\phi_y}$. Then, a fully connected neural network is used to map $\\bm\\mu_{\\bm\\phi_y}$ to the latent space, $\\bm\\mu_{\\bm\\phi_h}$, of the PDE solution $h(\\bm{x},t)$. Finally, a decoder is utilized to reconstruct $h(\\bm{x},t)$. The innovative aspect of our model is its ability to train its three components independently. This approach leads to a substantial decrease in both the time and energy required for training when compared to leading operator learning models such as FNO and DeepONet. The separable training is achieved by training the encoder as part of the variational autoencoder (VAE) for $y(\\bm{x})$ and the decoder as part of the $h(\\bm{x},t)$ VAE. We refer to this model as the VAE-DNN model.

A recent study by Park et al. in Complex Networks and their Applications 2024 showed that this problem is evident in clusterings from three Stochastic Block Models (SBMs) in graph-tool, a popular software package. To address this issue, Park et al. presented a simple technique, Well-Connected Clusters (WCC), that repeatedly finds and removes small edge cuts of size at most $\\log_{10}n$ in clusters, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the cluster, and showed that treatment of graph-tool SBM clusterings with WCC improves accuracy. Here we examine the question of cluster connectivity for clusterings computed using other SBM software or nested SBMs within graph-tool. Our study, using a wide range of real-world and synthetic networks, shows that all tested SBM clustering methods produce communities that are disconnected, and that graph-tool improves on PySBM. We provide insight into why graph-tool degree-corrected SBM clustering produces disconnected clusters by examining the description length formula it uses, and explore the impact of modifications to the description length formula.

This paper presents an effective spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages crowdsourced user-side key performance indicators (KPIs) and regulatory datasets to model and forecast spectrum demand. The proposed methodology achieves superior prediction accuracy and cross-regional generalizability by incorporating advanced feature engineering, comprehensive correlation analysis, and transfer learning techniques. Unlike traditional ITU models, which are often constrained by arbitrary inputs and unrealistic assumptions, this approach exploits granular, data-driven insights to account for spatial and temporal variations in spectrum utilization.

However, their growing openness and interaction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial attacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as dedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this paradigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection, and (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised, system-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents further raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Evo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than relying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to simultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats, ensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure. Furthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing reinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial training paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS performance under co-evolving threats. Experiments show that Evo-MARL reduces attack success rates by up to 22% while boosting accuracy by up to 5% on reasoning tasks-demonstrating that safety and utility can be jointly improved.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

These methods include various types of manual mapping, module stomping, and threadless injection which work entirely within the address space of a legitimate process, presenting a challenge for detection due to ambiguity between what is legitimate and what isn't. Existing tools often have weaknesses, such as a dependency on Portable Executable (PE) structures or a vulnerability to time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race conditions where an adversary cleans up before a periodic scan has the chance to occur. To address this gap, we present RX-INT, a kernel-assisted system featuring an architecture that provides resilience against TOCTOU attacks. RX-INT introduces a detection engine that combines a real-time thread creation monitor with a stateful Virtual Address Descriptor (VAD) scanner alongside various heuristics within. This engine snapshots both private and image-backed memory regions, using real-time memory hashing to detect illicit modifications like module stomping. Critically, we demonstrate a higher detection rate in certain benchmarks of this approach through a direct comparison with PE-sieve, a commonly used and powerful memory forensics tool.

We analyzed a gold standard dataset of 4,495 app reviews enriched with metadata (e.g., app version, ratings, age restriction, in-app purchases). Correlation analyses identified mostly weak associations between app properties and explanation needs, with moderate correlations only for specific features such as app version, number of reviews, and star ratings. Linear regression models showed limited predictive power, with no reliable forecasts across configurations. Validation on a manually labeled dataset of 495 reviews confirmed these findings. Categories such as Security & Privacy and System Behavior showed slightly higher predictive potential, while Interaction and User Interface remained most difficult to predict.

Having precise estimations and uncertainties plays a crucial role in planning and control algorithms to explore safe and reliable maneuver strategies. However, existing approaches, such as Gaussian Processes (GPs) and neural network-based methods, often fail to meet these needs. They are either unable to perform in real-time due to high computational demands, underestimating sharp geometry changes, or harming elevation accuracy when learned with uncertainties. Recently, Neural Processes (NPs) have emerged as a promising approach that integrates the Bayesian uncertainty estimation of GPs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural networks. Inspired by NPs, we propose an effective NP-based method that precisely estimates sharp elevation changes and quantifies the corresponding predictive uncertainty without losing elevation accuracy. Our method leverages semantic features from LiDAR and camera sensors to improve interpolation and extrapolation accuracy in unobserved regions.

Unfortunately, state-of-the-art application classifiers overlook such traffic in curated datasets and only classify relevant application traffic. To address this issue, when we label and train using an additional class for background traffic, it leads to additional confusion between application and background traffic, as the latter is heterogeneous and encompasses all traffic that is not relevant to the application sessions. To avoid falsely classifying background traffic as one of the relevant application types, a reliable confidence measure is warranted, such that we can refrain from classifying uncertain samples.

Vector processors are fully programmable and achieve high energy efficiencies by exploiting data parallelism, amortizing instruction fetch and decoding costs. Hence, a promising design choice is to build accelerators based on shared L1-memory clusters of streamlined Vector Processing Elements (VPEs). However, current state-of-the-art VPEs are limited in L1 memory bandwidth and achieve high efficiency only for computational kernels with high data reuse in the Vector Register File (VRF), such as General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM). Performance is suboptimal for workloads with lower data reuse like General Matrix-Vector Multiplication (GEMV). To fully exploit available bandwidth at the L1 memory interface, the VPE micro-architecture must be optimized to achieve near-ideal utilization, i.e., to be as close as possible to the L1 memory roofline (at-the-roofline). In this work, we propose TROOP, a set of hardware optimizations that include decoupled load-store interfaces, improved vector chaining, shadow buffers to hide VRF conflicts, and address scrambling techniques to achieve at-the-roofline performance for VPEs without compromising their area and energy efficiency.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent agents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly through social interactions. However, social interactions have two key characteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability, where utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit assignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as rapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal achievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL with single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To address these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines coarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards. Utterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by attributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards capture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking. Experiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate that Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17 on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Also, we find that adding new samples to the training set using active learning does improve model performance but that in general, the rate of improvement is slower than the results reported in the literature suggest. We attribute this difference to an improved experimental design where distinct data samples are used for the sampling and testing pools. Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of transfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets and find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail off as more target points are selected for inclusion in training. This tail-off in performance may indicate that the active learning process is doing a good job of sequencing data points for selection, pushing the less useful points towards the end of the selection process and that this tail-off occurs when these less useful points are eventually added.

In this work, we introduce a more robust and flexible paradigm: enabling agents to use coding as a enhanced action. We present CoAct-1, a novel multi-agent system that synergistically combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic execution. CoAct-1 features an Orchestrator that dynamically delegates subtasks to either a conventional GUI Operator or a specialized Programmer agent, which can write and execute Python or Bash scripts. This hybrid approach allows the agent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management and data processing, while still leveraging visual interaction when necessary. We evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, where CoAct-1 achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves efficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to just 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents.

We propose a combined manifold and machine learning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent crowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The proposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation Equation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and multiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the mass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first step, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete microscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based on manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space into the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the corresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning reduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning techniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the crowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density profiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density distribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this \"embed->learn in latent space->lift back to the ambient space\" pipeline, we create an effective solution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution. For our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a corridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions.

In this paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions.

We use the techniques for extracting squares from runs described by Crochemore et al. [TCS 2014]. However, the packed model requires novel approaches. We need an $O(n/\\log_\\sigma n)$-sized representation of all long-period runs (runs with period $\\Omega(\\log_\\sigma n)$) which allows for a sublinear-time counting of the -- potentially linearly-many -- implied squares. The long-period runs with a string period that is periodic itself (called layer runs) are an obstacle, since their number can be $\\Omega(n)$.

Another difficulty lies in computing the locations of Lyndon roots of runs in packed strings, which is needed for grouping runs that may generate equal squares.

To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional Optimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework that strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups using optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable proportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged group. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between reducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance. Furthermore, we extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions to concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic, public, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms existing post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios, often achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive gains in utility.

This protocol is straightforward, useful and practical, but it only captures performance of a particular model trained at some point in the past. We know, however, that online systems evolve over time. In general, it is a good idea that models reflect such changes, so models are frequently retrained with recent data. But if this is the case, to what extent can we trust previous evaluations? How will a model perform when a different pattern (re)emerges? In this paper we propose a methodology to study how recommendation models behave when they are retrained. The idea is to profile algorithms according to their ability to, on the one hand, retain past patterns -- stability -- and, on the other hand, (quickly) adapt to changes -- plasticity. We devise an offline evaluation protocol that provides detail on the long-term behavior of models, and that is agnostic to datasets, algorithms and metrics. To illustrate the potential of this framework, we present preliminary results of three different types of algorithms on the GoodReads dataset that suggest different stability and plasticity profiles depending on the algorithmic technique, and a possible trade-off between stability and this http URL additional experiments will be necessary to confirm these observations, they already illustrate the usefulness of the proposed framework to gain insights on the long term dynamics of recommendation models.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

Similar to prior work using pose variations for data generation, CP-Gen first decomposes expert demonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills. But unlike those works, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as keypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must track a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To generate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for each task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its associated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint configurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the transformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to the first optimized joint configuration.

Typical functional approaches to synthesize controllers against $\\omega$-regular specifications rely on combining inductive invariants (for example, via barrier certificates) with proofs of well-foundedness (for example, via ranking functions). Transition invariants, provide an alternative where instead of standard well-foundedness arguments one may instead search for disjunctive well-foundedness arguments that together ensure a well-foundedness argument. Closure certificates, functional analogs of transition invariants, provide an effective, automated approach to verify discrete-time dynamical systems against linear temporal logic and $\\omega$-regular specifications. We build on this notion to synthesize controllers to ensure the satisfaction of $\\omega$-regular specifications. To do so, we first illustrate how one may construct control closure certificates to visit a region infinitely often (or only finitely often) via disjunctive well-founded arguments. We then combine these arguments to provide an argument for parity specifications. Thus, finding an appropriate control closure certificate over the product of the system and a parity automaton specifying a desired $\\omega$-regular specification ensures that there exists a controller $\\kappa$ to enforce the $\\omega$-regular specification.

Understanding how these compressed models behave under adversarial attacks is essential for their safe and effective deployment in real-world applications. To bridge this knowledge gap, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of how common compression strategies affect the adversarial robustness of compressed models. We assess the robustness of compressed versions of three widely used language models for code across three software analytics tasks, using six evaluation metrics and four commonly used classical adversarial attacks. Our findings indicate that compressed models generally maintain comparable performance to their uncompressed counterparts.

To mitigate the inherent spectral bias in deep learning, BubbleONet integrates the Rowdy adaptive activation function, enabling improved representation of high-frequency features. The model is evaluated across various scenarios, including: (1) Rayleigh-Plesset equation based bubble dynamics with a single initial radius, (2) Keller-Miksis equation based bubble dynamics with a single initial radius, and (3) Keller-Miksis equation based bubble dynamics with multiple initial radii. Moreover, the performance of single-step versus two-step training techniques for BubbleONet is investigated.

We used three prompt variants with GPT-4o: input-output examples (data-only), textual description of the task (text-only), and a combination of both textual descriptions and input-output examples (data-text). Additionally, we varied the number of input-output examples available for building programs. For each synthesizer and task combination, we compared success rates across all program synthesizers, as well as the similarity between successful GPT-4o synthesized programs.

While RAG methods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation models, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge underexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with generalization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and model-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID dynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with category-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further integrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the query, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID generates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images from a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched input for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%. RAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining high accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG compression. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under degradation conditions, compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model C2P-CLIP, demonstrating consistent improvements in both Gaussian blur and JPEG compression scenarios.

Existing systems are often limited to controlled environments, constrained to in-person interactions, and rely on rigid assumptions such as the presence of two speakers within a fixed time window. These limitations reduce their generalizability to capture diverse real-world interactions. To address these challenges, we developed a real-time, on-watch system capable of detecting both in-person and virtual interactions.

There are some key issues in the development of crowdsensing such as platform security and privacy protection. As the crowdsensing is usually managed by a centralized platform, centralized management will bring various security vulnerabilities and scalability issues. To solve these issues, an effective reputation-based partition scheme (RSPC) is proposed in this article. The partition scheme calculates the optimal partition size by combining the node reputation value and divides the node into several disjoint partitions according to the node reputation value. By selecting the appropriate partition size, RSPC provides a mechanism to ensure that each partition is valid, as long as themaximum permissible threshold for the failed node is observed. At the same time, the RSPC reorganizes the network periodically to avoid partition attacks. In addition, for cross-partition transactions, this paper innovatively proposes a four-stage confirmation protocol to ensure the efficient and safe completion of cross-partition transactions. Finally, experiments show that RSPC improves scalability, low latency, and high throughput for crowdsensing.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

In this paper, we investigate the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance of deep learning models for nutritional estimation using only 2D images.

The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators create a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social exchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group and providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but \"black box\" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues. We address this important demand with a social robot co-facilitator that analyzes multimodal meeting data and provides discreet cues to the facilitator.

However, current blockchain systems suffer from limited throughput, poor scalability, and high latency. Due to limitations in consensus mechanisms, especially in managing node identities, blockchain is often considered unsuitable for applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper proposes the Advanced DAG-based Ranking (ADR) protocol to enhance blockchain scalability and throughput. ADR employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure where nodes are positioned based on their rankings. Unlike traditional chains, ADR allows honest nodes to write blocks and verify transactions using a DAG-based topology. The protocol follows a three-step approach to secure the network against double-spending and enhance performance. First, it verifies nodes using their public and private keys before granting entry. Second, it builds an advanced DAG ledger enabling block production and transaction validation. Third, a ranking algorithm filters out malicious nodes, ranks the remaining nodes based on performance, and arranges them topologically. This process increases throughput and ensures robust scalability. We evaluated ADR on Amazon EC2 clusters with over 100 nodes, including scenarios with injected malicious nodes. Simulation results demonstrate that ADR significantly improves transaction throughput and network liveness compared to existing DAG-based blockchains such as IOTA and ByteBall, making it well-suited for IoT applications.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

System-level simulation is therefore indispensable, yet the vast majority of studies rely on the statistical 3GPP channel models. These are well suited to capture average behavior across many statistical realizations, but cannot reproduce site-specific phenomena such as corner diffraction, street-canyon blockage, or deterministic line-of-sight conditions and angle-of-departure/arrival relationships that drive directional links. This paper extends 5G-LENA, an NR module for the system-level Network Simulator 3 (ns-3), with a trace-based channel model that processes the Multipath Components (MPCs) obtained from external ray-tracers (e.g., Sionna Ray Tracer (RT)) or measurement campaigns. Our module constructs frequency-domain channel matrices and feeds them to the existing Physical (PHY)/Medium Access Control (MAC) stack without any further modifications. The result is a geometry-based channel model that remains fully compatible with the standard 3GPP implementation in 5G-LENA, while delivering site-specific geometric fidelity. This new module provides a key building block toward Digital Twin (DT) capabilities by offering realistic site-specific channel modeling, unlocking studies that require site awareness, including beam management, blockage mitigation, and environment-aware sensing. We demonstrate its capabilities for precise beam-steering validation and end-to-end metric analysis. In both cases, the trace-driven engine exposes performance inflections that the statistical model does not exhibit, confirming its value for high-fidelity system-level cellular networks research and as a step toward DT applications.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

To address this issue, we introduce Decoupled Contrastive Learning for Federated Learning (DCFL), a novel framework that decouples the existing contrastive loss into two objectives. Decoupling the loss into its alignment and uniformity components enables the independent calibration of the attraction and repulsion forces without relying on the asymptotic assumptions. This strategy provides a contrastive learning method suitable for federated learning environments where each client has a small amount of data. Our experimental results show that DCFL achieves stronger alignment between positive samples and greater uniformity between negative samples compared to existing contrastive learning methods.

However, current voice-based interfaces struggle to support composing more detailed, contextually complex texts, especially in scenarios where users are on the move and cannot visually track progress.

We introduce StepWrite, a large language model-driven voice-based interaction system that augments human writing ability by enabling structured, hands-free and eyes-free composition of longer-form texts while on the move. StepWrite decomposes the writing process into manageable subtasks and sequentially guides users with contextually-aware non-visual audio prompts. StepWrite reduces cognitive load by offloading the context-tracking and adaptive planning tasks to the models.

An empirical evaluation with 25 participants engaging in mobile or stationary hands-occupied activities demonstrated that StepWrite significantly reduces cognitive load, improves usability and user satisfaction compared to baseline methods. Technical evaluations further confirmed StepWrite's capability in dynamic contextual prompt generation, accurate tone alignment, and effective fact checking.

Simultaneously, power grids are grappling with the instability introduced by the high penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES). This paper addresses these dual challenges through a novel Two-Stage Co-Optimization (TSCO) framework that synergistically manages power system dispatch and CPN task scheduling to achieve low-carbon operations. The framework decomposes the complex, large-scale problem into a day-ahead stochastic unit commitment (SUC) stage and a real-time operational stage. The former is solved using Benders decomposition for computational tractability, while in the latter, economic dispatch of generation assets is coupled with an adaptive CPN task scheduling managed by a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent. This agent makes intelligent, carbon-aware decisions by responding to dynamic grid conditions, including real-time electricity prices and marginal carbon intensity. Through extensive simulations on an IEEE 30-bus system integrated with a CPN, the TSCO framework is shown to significantly outperform baseline approaches.

Even emerging class-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations and a neglect of target structural information. Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network (PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete ground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its variant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key modules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures semantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract unbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure Coordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first, structure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic cognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the semantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.

First, it modularizes SQL operations into fine-grained tools for context retrieval, CRUD execution, and ACID-compliant transaction management, enabling more precise and LLM-friendly functionality controls. Second, it aligns tool implementations with both database privileges and user security policies to steer LLMs away from unsafe or unauthorized operations, improving task execution efficiency while safeguarding database security. Third, it introduces a proxy mechanism for seamless inter-tool data transfer, bypassing LLM transmission bottlenecks. All of these designs are database-agnostic and can be transparently integrated with existing agent architectures. We also release an open-source implementation of BridgeScope for PostgreSQL. Evaluations on two novel benchmarks demonstrate that BridgeScope enables LLM agents to operate databases more effectively, reduces token usage by up to 80% through improved security awareness, and uniquely supports data-intensive workflows beyond existing toolkits, establishing BridgeScope as a robust foundation for next-generation intelligent data automation.", "comments": "6 pages, 6 figures", "project_url": ""}

Recently, large language models(LLMs) have demonstrated potential in serendipity recommendation, thanks to their extensive world knowledge and superior reasoning capabilities. However, these models still face challenges in ensuring the rationality of the reasoning process, the usefulness of the reasoning results, and meeting the latency requirements of industrial recommendation systems (RSs). To address these challenges, we propose a method that leverages llm to dynamically construct user knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the serendipity of recommendation systems. This method comprises a two stage framework:(1) two-hop interest reasoning, where user static profiles and historical behaviors are utilized to dynamically construct user knowledge graphs via llm. Two-hop reasoning, which can enhance the quality and accuracy of LLM reasoning results, is then performed on the constructed graphs to identify users' potential interests; and(2) Near-line adaptation, a cost-effective approach to deploying the aforementioned models in industrial recommendation systems. We propose a u2i (user-to-item) retrieval model that also incorporates i2i (item-to-item) retrieval capabilities, the retrieved items not only exhibit strong relevance to users' newly emerged interests but also retain the high conversion rate of traditional u2i retrieval.

However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations. To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise spatial inference.

In this paper, we observe that the controllability of texts generated by the powerful prefix-based method Air-Decoding tends to decline with increasing sequence length, which we hypothesize primarily arises from the observed decay in attention to the prefixes. Meanwhile, different types of prefixes including soft and hard prefixes are also key factors influencing performance. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight and effective framework called Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation (DTPA) based on Air-Decoding for controllable text generation.

Then we dynamically amplify the attention to the prefix for the attribute distribution to enhance controllability, with a scaling factor growing exponentially as the sequence length increases. Moreover, based on the task, we optionally apply a similar augmentation to the original prompt for the raw distribution to balance text quality. After attribute distribution reconstruction, the generated text satisfies the attribute constraints well.

However, current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be resolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information signals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive Information Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to both sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance efficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy through contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection. Experimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries) while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior baselines on average.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models' ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention (CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This is achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones, significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information, thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation performance of TCSAFormer.

DRIVE leverages exponential-family likelihood modeling to estimate the feasibility of state transitions, constructing a probabilistic representation of soft behavioral rules that vary across driving contexts. These learned rule distributions are then embedded into a convex optimization-based planning module, enabling the generation of trajectories that are not only dynamically feasible but also compliant with inferred human preferences.

In recent years, multi-view clustering has attracted increasing attention due to its ability to integrate complementary information from multiple views. However, existing methods primarily focus on clustering performance, while fairness-a critical concern in human-centered applications-has been largely overlooked. Although recent studies have explored group fairness in multi-view clustering, most methods impose explicit regularization on cluster assignments, relying on the alignment between sensitive attributes and the underlying cluster structure. However, this assumption often fails in practice and can degrade clustering performance. In this paper, we propose an adversarial fair multi-view clustering (AFMVC) framework that integrates fairness learning into the representation learning process. Specifically, our method employs adversarial training to fundamentally remove sensitive attribute information from learned features, ensuring that the resulting cluster assignments are unaffected by it. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that aligning view-specific clustering assignments with a fairness-invariant consensus distribution via KL divergence preserves clustering consistency without significantly compromising fairness, thereby providing additional theoretical guarantees for our framework.

To address these deficiencies, we introduce the Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model (GM-PRM), a novel paradigm that transforms the PRM from a passive judge into an active reasoning collaborator. Instead of a simple scalar score, GM-PRM provides a fine-grained, interpretable analysis of each reasoning step, evaluating its step intent, visual alignment, and logical soundness.

A rigorous specification of weak memory models is therefore essential to make this problem tractable for developers of safety- and security-critical, low-level software. In this paper we survey the field of formalisations of weak memory models, including their specification, their effects on execution, and tools and inference systems for reasoning about code. To assist the discussion we also provide an introduction to two styles of formal representation found commonly in the literature (using a much simplified version of Intel's x86 as the example): a step-by-step construction of traces of the system (operational semantics); and with respect to relations between memory events (axiomatic semantics).

Existing techniques either construct the DFA compositionally before solving the game, leveraging automata minimization to mitigate state-space explosion, or build the DFA incrementally during game solving to avoid full DFA construction. However, neither is dominant.

This framework applies composition during game solving instead of automata (game arena) construction. While composing all intermediate results may be necessary in the worst case, pruning these results simplifies subsequent compositions and enables early detection of unrealizability. Specifically, the framework allows two composition variants: pruning before composition to take full advantage of minimization or pruning during composition to guide on-the-fly synthesis.

We advocate the powers of complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that typifies previous works.

Recent works mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios.

Recently, the introduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging rule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions and guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across many replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses under a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or incorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to vanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for learning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization framework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome consistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs show high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives meaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and self-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we incorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances local advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic transitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method introduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization strategy. We validate its effectiveness through substantial performance gains on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, highlighting the proposed framework's robustness and general applicability.

Existing studies show that incorporating search signals boosts recommendation performance. However, the effectiveness of these methods relies heavily on rich search interactions. They primarily benefit a small subset of users with abundant search behavior, while offering limited improvements for the majority of users who exhibit only sparse search activity. To address the problem of sparse search data in search-enhanced recommendation, we face two key challenges: (1) how to learn useful search features for users with sparse search interactions, and (2) how to design effective training objectives under sparse conditions. Our idea is to leverage the features of users with rich search interactions to enhance those of users with sparse search interactions. Based on this idea, we propose GSERec, a method that utilizes message passing on the User-Code Graphs to alleviate data sparsity in Search-Enhanced Recommendation. Specifically, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) with vector quantization to generate discrete codes, which connect similar users and thereby construct the graph. Through message passing on this graph, embeddings of users with rich search data are propagated to enhance the embeddings of users with sparse interactions. To further ensure that the message passing captures meaningful information from truly similar users, we introduce a contrastive loss to better model user similarities. The enhanced user representations are then integrated into downstream search-enhanced recommendation models.

While incremental learning enables adaptation to multiple tasks, it struggles to achieve generalization in few-shot scenarios. Consequently, when the weight data follows a long-tailed distribution, it can lead to forgetting in the fused weights. To address this issue, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA Fusion (ICM-Fusion), a novel framework that synergizes meta-learning with in-context adaptation.

To mitigate this, selective encryption has emerged as a promising approach, encrypting only a subset of gradient data based on the data's significance under a certain metric. However, there have been few systematic studies on how to specify this metric in practice. This paper systematically evaluates selective encryption methods with different significance metrics against state-of-the-art attacks.

Memes, as a widely used mode of online communication, often serve as vehicles for spreading harmful content. However, limitations in data accessibility and the high cost of dataset curation hinder the development of robust meme moderation systems. To address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset of 6,300 real-world meme-based posts annotated in two stages: (i) binary classification into toxic and normal, and (ii) fine-grained labelling of toxic memes as hateful, dangerous, or offensive. A key feature of this dataset is that it is enriched with auxiliary metadata of socially relevant tags, enhancing the context of each meme. In addition, we propose a tag generation module that produces socially grounded tags, because most in-the-wild memes often do not come with tags. Experimental results show that incorporating these tags substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs detection tasks.

While existing approaches focus primarily on technical resilience metrics and enhancement strategies, there remains a significant gap in establishing market-driven mechanisms that can effectively commercialize resilience features while optimizing their deployment through intelligent decision-making. Moreover, traditional optimization approaches for distribution network reconfiguration often fail to dynamically adapt to both normal and emergency conditions. This paper introduces a novel framework integrating dual-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with market-based mechanisms, achieving an average resilience score of 0.85 0.08 over 10 test episodes. The proposed architecture leverages a dual-agent PPO scheme, where a strategic agent selects optimal DER-driven switching configurations, while a tactical agent fine-tunes individual switch states and grid preferences under budget and weather constraints. These agents interact within a custom-built dynamic simulation environment that models stochastic calamity events, budget limits, and resilience-cost trade-offs. A comprehensive reward function is designed that balances resilience enhancement objectives with market profitability (with up to 200x reward incentives, resulting in 85% of actions during calamity steps selecting configurations with 4 DERs), incorporating factors such as load recovery speed, system robustness, and customer satisfaction. Over 10 test episodes, the framework achieved a benefit-cost ratio of 0.12 0.01, demonstrating sustainable market incentives for resilience investment.

A core challenge, however, lies in the increasing adoption of anti-hooking techniques by advanced keyloggers. Anti-hooking strategies allow malware to bypass or detect instrumentation. To counter this, we introduce a hardened hooking layer that detects tampering and rapidly reinstates disrupted hooks, ensuring continuity of deception. We evaluate our framework against a custom-built \"super keylogger\" incorporating multiple evasion strategies, as well as 50 real-world malware samples spanning ten prominent keylogger families.

To address this gap, we conduct an in-depth study on backdoor attacks against MLTSF models and propose the first effective attack method named BadTime. BadTime executes a backdoor attack by poisoning training data and customizing the backdoor training process. During data poisoning, BadTime proposes a contrast-guided strategy to select the most suitable training samples for poisoning, then employs a graph attention network to identify influential variables for trigger injection. Subsequently, BadTime further localizes optimal positions for trigger injection based on lag analysis and proposes a puzzle-like trigger structure that distributes the trigger across multiple poisoned variables to jointly steer the prediction of the target variable. During backdoor training, BadTime alternately optimizes the model and triggers via proposed tailored optimization objectives.

However, training samples easily contain private information and incorrect knowledge that are difficult to detect, potentially leading to privacy leakage or erroneous outputs after deployment. An intuitive idea is to reprocess the training set to remove unwanted content and retrain the model from scratch. Yet, this is impractical due to significant computational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning has emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by selectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while preserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no available datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection in biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built upon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic private data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets two key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is mistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally respond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where wrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset, leading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning Efficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance across different subsets.

To systematically address these challenges, we employ three sequential strategies. First, we introduce a parameterized integral equation formulation that circumvents traditional shape derivative computations. Second, we develop a shape-adaptive reduced basis method (RBM) that utilizes the eigenfunctions of the Neumann-Poincar\u00e9 operator for forward problems and their adjoint counterparts for adjoint problems, thereby addressing singularities and accelerating computations. Third, we propose a physics-informed initialization strategy that estimates nanoparticle configurations under weak coupling assumptions, thereby improving the performance of gradient-based optimization algorithms. The method's computational advantages are demonstrated through numerical experiments, which show accurate and efficient designs across various geometric configurations. Furthermore, the framework is flexible and extensible to other material systems and boundary conditions.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and reinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited generalization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for enhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and reasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset dependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates grounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object localization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then builds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning accuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning path to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby reducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy. Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess whether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in enhancing reasoning reliability.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

In this work, we aim to address the above challenges within the context of document image classification by substituting real private data with a synthetic counterpart. In particular, we propose to use conditional latent diffusion models (LDMs) in combination with differential privacy (DP) to generate class-specific synthetic document images under strict privacy constraints, which can then be utilized to train a downstream classifier following standard training procedures.

Intuitively, it has been established that the most recent interactions are more indicative of future preferences than older interactions. Many recommendation algorithms use this notion to either drop older interactions or to assign them a lower weight, so the model can focus on the more informative, recent information. However, very few approaches model the flow of time explicitly. This paper analyzes how time can be encoded in factorization-style recommendation models. By including absolute time as a feature, our models can learn varying user preferences and changing item perception over time. In addition to simple binning approaches, we also propose a novel, fully continuous time encoding mechanism. Through the use of a polynomial fit inside the loss function, our models completely avoid the need for discretization, and they are able to capture the time dimension in arbitrary resolution. We perform a comparative study on three real-world datasets that span multiple years, where long user histories are present, and items stay relevant for a longer time. Empirical results show that, by explicitly modeling time, our models are very effective at capturing temporal signals, such as varying item popularities over time. Despite this however, our experiments also indicate that a simple post-hoc popularity adjustment is often sufficient to achieve the best performance on the unseen test set. This teaches us that, for the recommendation task, predicting the future is more important than capturing past trends. As such, we argue that specialized mechanisms are needed for extrapolation to future data.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image stitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on the novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry grounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene reconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto a designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving pixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image.

Despite its importance, the questions of what information should be shared, how much should be communicated, and how frequently updates should be dispatched remain open research challenges. This manuscript proposes an information bulletin strategy defined around two models of the system descriptor states to address these fundamental questions. The strategy is that queues periodically broadcast these information models to tenants at different time intervals, who may respond by reneging from the queue or jockeying to a more favorable one. The expectation is that over time, the queues adapt their processing rates based on what they learn from the tenant behavior. The objective is to minimize overall delay and the impatience. We formulate for this impatience as an optimization problem, whose analytical solution is intractable. We perform numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the learned queue policy and to assess how closely it approaches optimal conditions.", "comments": "Submitted to IEEE CSCN 2025", "project_url": ""}

Five pre-trained models were used to extract images features, and these features were passed to a custom shallow network for Doppler angle estimation. Independently, measurements were obtained by a human observer reviewing the images for comparison. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the automated and manual angle estimates ranged from 3.9\u00b0 to 9.4\u00b0 for the models evaluated. Furthermore, the MAE for the best performing model was less than the acceptable clinical Doppler angle error threshold thus avoiding misclassification of normal velocity values as a stenosis.

To address these limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.

Recent advancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained Vision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct Fine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes, remains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a performance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe catastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex mitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is flawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two standard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using two representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed probing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under DFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further investigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting primarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than from degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we propose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates strategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned classifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers.

While prior works have demonstrated that conventional deep ANNs can develop topographic representations, these models largely neglect crucial temporal dynamics. This oversight often leads to significant performance degradation in tasks like object recognition and compromises their biological fidelity. To address this, we leverage spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently capture spike-based temporal dynamics and offer enhanced biological plausibility. We propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic deep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs), successfully replicating the hierarchical spatial functional organization observed in the primate visual cortex from low-level sensory input to high-level abstract representations. Our results show that STC effectively generates representative topographic features across simulated visual cortical areas.

We also reveal that topographic organization facilitates efficient and stable temporal information processing via the spike mechanism in TDSNNs, contributing to model robustness.

While on-device AI becomes popular, supporting multiple tasks on edge devices imposes significant resource challenges. To address this, we introduce S2M3, a split-and-share multi-modal architecture for multi-task inference on edge devices. Inspired by the general-purpose nature of multi-modal models, which are composed of multiple modules (encoder, decoder, classifier, etc.), we propose to split multi-modal models at functional-level modules; and then share common modules to reuse them across tasks, thereby reducing resource usage.

Through experiments on a testbed consisting of 14 multi-modal models across 5 tasks and 10 benchmarks, we demonstrate that S2M3 can reduce memory usage by up to 50% and 62% in single-task and multi-task settings, respectively, without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, S2M3 achieves optimal placement in 89 out of 95 instances (93.7%) while reducing inference latency by up to 56.9% on resource-constrained devices, compared to cloud AI.", "comments": "Accepted at IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2025)", "project_url": ""}

To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods solely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the complementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to tackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally and simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval. These designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video moment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or background sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end, we propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which learns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts for VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and audio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance predictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly assigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we design a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and visual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their complementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation strategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference. To evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e., Charades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and re-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability in utilizing audio modality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art with audio-video fusion in VMR methods.

Targeting this attack surface, we propose two knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs) and demonstrate that modifying only a few words in the source text can significantly change the constructed graph, poison the GraphRAG, and severely mislead downstream reasoning. The first attack, named Targeted KPA (TKPA), utilizes graph-theoretic analysis to locate vulnerable nodes in the generated graphs and rewrites the corresponding narratives with LLMs, achieving precise control over specific question-answering (QA) outcomes with a success rate of 93.1\\%, while keeping the poisoned text fluent and natural.

While various approaches have emerged for this task, they face inherent trade-offs: rule-based solutions face challenges in meeting code safety and idiomaticity requirements, while LLM-based solutions often fail to generate semantically equivalent Rust code, due to the heavy dependencies of modules across the entire codebase. Recent studies have revealed that both solutions are limited to small-scale programs. In this paper, we propose EvoC2Rust, an automated framework for converting entire C projects to equivalent Rust ones. EvoC2Rust employs a skeleton-guided translation strategy for project-level translation. The pipeline consists of three evolutionary stages: 1) it first decomposes the C project into functional modules, employs a feature-mapping-enhanced LLM to transform definitions and macros and generates type-checked function stubs, which form a compilable Rust skeleton; 2) it then incrementally translates the function, replacing the corresponding stub placeholder; 3) finally, it repairs compilation errors by integrating LLM and static analysis. Through evolutionary augmentation, EvoC2Rust combines the advantages of both rule-based and LLM-based solutions. Our evaluation on open-source benchmarks and six industrial projects demonstrates EvoC2Rust's superior performance in project-level C-to-Rust translation. On average, it achieves 17.24% and 14.32% improvements in syntax and semantic accuracy over the LLM-based approaches, along with a 96.79% higher code safety rate than the rule-based tools.

However, data distribution disparities due to heterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a shortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes a foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder, named MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples, encompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter security, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset signals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a self-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of DAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition tasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes only a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the Transformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super platform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The VPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322% of parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT) method by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits robust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality, efficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach offers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal recognition models in the DAS domain.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

Positive tokens can be trained in common ways, whereas negative tokens, which may lack essential semantics or be misleading, should be explicitly forgotten.

The experiments yield several novel insights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain. First, the current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when fine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\\% F1. Second, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results, some lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent performance.

Existing Private Inference (PI) methods face a fundamental trade-off between privacy and efficiency: cryptographic approaches offer strong protection but incur high computational overhead, while efficient alternatives such as split inference expose intermediate features to inversion attacks. We propose PrivDFS, a new paradigm for private inference that replaces a single exposed representation with distributed feature sharing. PrivDFS partitions input features on the client into multiple balanced shares, which are distributed to non-colluding, non-communicating servers for independent partial inference. The client securely aggregates the servers' outputs to reconstruct the final prediction, ensuring that no single server observes sufficient information to compromise input privacy. To further strengthen privacy, we propose two key extensions: PrivDFS-AT, which uses adversarial training with a diffusion-based proxy attacker to enforce inversion-resistant feature partitioning, and PrivDFS-KD, which leverages user-specific keys to diversify partitioning policies and prevent query-based inversion generalization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CelebA demonstrate that PrivDFS achieves privacy comparable to deep split inference while cutting client computation by up to 100 times with no accuracy loss, and that the extensions remain robust against both diffusion-based in-distribution and adaptive attacks.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

It consists of a convection-diffusion equation for SPIONs, a modified Navier-Stokes system for the averaged velocity of the carrier fluid-nanoparticle mixture and a quasi-stationary Maxwell system for the magnetic variables. The derived model extends previous models for MDT by taking into account the response of the carrier fluid and of the magnetic field to the dynamics of the SPIONs, and thus provides a comprehensive tool for the prediction and optimization of MDT processes. After introducing a semi-implicit finite element scheme for the numerical simulation of the model, simulation results for the fully coupled model are performed and compared with results from a reduced version of the model, where the response of the carrier flow and of the magnetic field to the SPION dynamics is neglected. Furthermore, the sensitivity of MDT with respect to experimental parameters, such as magnet positioning, is investigated.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

Static benchmarks lack agency, while interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically ignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm, we introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate, but to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the full sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence, OmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create scenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine cross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal models reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on high-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges requiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this fragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic performance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive \"less is more\" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically improve performance. Our findings suggest that the path toward robust AGI requires a research focus beyond scaling to explicitly address synergistic fusion.

The limitation arises from MLLMs' context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before feeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform sampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained by the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile, building a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient rule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long video training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and video Needle-in-a-Haystack data.

This paper investigates a pocket-sized companion robot designed to offer a relaxation technique requiring no prior training, with a focus on immediate impact on the user's heart rate. The robot utilizes a tactile game to divert the user's attention, thereby promoting relaxation. We conducted two studies with children who were not diagnosed with anxiety: a 14-day pilot study with two children (age 8) and a main study with 18 children (ages 7-8). Both studies employed a within-subjects design and focused on measuring heart rate during tactile interaction with the robot and during non-use. Interacting with the robot was found to significantly lower the study participants' heart rate (p$<$0.01) compared to the non-use condition, indicating a consistent calming effect across all participants.

However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time series remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time series; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB three-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between the deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose VisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on large-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a vision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series data, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2) a colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time series into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate dependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus more flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive prior distributional assumptions.

In the proposed scheme, users are divided into groups where each group is served in a different time slot using TDMA. Within each group, up to two users can be served simultaneously using NOMA. A central challenge lies in determining which users should be paired together for NOMA, as the effectiveness of successive interference cancellation (SIC) employed by NOMA depends on the difference between users' channel gains. To address this, for a pair of users, we determine the range of their channel gain ratio within which the pair benefits more from NOMA or TDMA. Identifying the lower and upper bounds of this range is formulated as two optimization problems which are solved efficiently using the Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) method.

Existing methods typically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation, restricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative representations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework, ProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity using a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a class-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes identity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural Network (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and prototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To further enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph prototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing intra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction. Additionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global classification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the embedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets demonstrate that ProtoN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Rank-1 identification accuracy of up to 99.60% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as 0.025, showing the effectiveness for few-shot ear recognition under limited data conditions.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing the epistemological challenge of \"creation without understanding\" that characterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's reliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic computational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot be analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of scaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities, I demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly sensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My investigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss thresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of emergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent properties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where systemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple components without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper concludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a new domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of emergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology.

We perform a thorough evaluation of the threshold choices and show that there is no single set of thresholds that perform well for all workloads and configurations, and that tuning can provide substantial speedups.

This systematic literature review analyzes research published between January 2020 and early 2024 that focuses on the explainability of multimodal models. Framed within the broader goals of XAI, we examine the literature across multiple dimensions, including model architecture, modalities involved, explanation algorithms and evaluation methodologies.

The system is grounded in official curriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching plan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess the generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified through a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method. The results demonstrate that RAG-based pipelines significantly outperform non-grounded prompting methods, producing questions with higher curriculum alignment and factual validity. The study further analyzes the trade-offs between the ease of implementation of framework-based RAG and the fine-grained control offered by a manual pipeline. This work presents a validated methodology for generating curriculum-specific educational content in a low-resource language, introduces a symbiotic RAG-QA evaluation technique, and provides actionable insights for the development and deployment of practical EdTech solutions in Malaysia and similar regions.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

This study sets out to provide a head-to-head, quantitative and qualitative evaluation of six automated approaches: three industry-standard rule-based static code-analysis tools (SonarQube, CodeQL and Snyk Code) and three state-of-the-art large language models hosted on the GitHub Models platform (GPT-4.1, Mistral Large and DeepSeek V3). Using a curated suite of ten real-world C# projects that embed 63 vulnerabilities across common categories such as SQL injection, hard-coded secrets and outdated dependencies, we measure classical detection accuracy (precision, recall, F-score), analysis latency, and the developer effort required to vet true positives. The language-based scanners achieve higher mean F-1 scores,0.797, 0.753 and 0.750, than their static counterparts, which score 0.260, 0.386 and 0.546, respectively. LLMs' advantage originates from superior recall, confirming an ability to reason across broader code contexts. However, this benefit comes with substantial trade-offs: DeepSeek V3 exhibits the highest false-positive ratio, all language models mislocate issues at line-or-column granularity due to tokenisation artefacts. Overall, language models successfully rival traditional static analysers in finding real vulnerabilities. Still, their noisier output and imprecise localisation limit their standalone use in safety-critical audits. We therefore recommend a hybrid pipeline: employ language models early in development for broad, context-aware triage, while reserving deterministic rule-based scanners for high-assurance verification.

Accordingly, we propose a new problem setting, where the learner has direct access to black-box components. This is in contrast with the usual problem settings of compositional learning, where the target is a legacy black-box system and queries can only be made to the whole system (but not to components).

We introduce a contextual componentwise learning algorithm that systematically removes such redundancies.

The design, validation, and testing for such systems therefore relies on a combination of mathematical modeling, abundant numerical simulations, and a relatively small set of real-world experiments. Due to modeling errors, simplifications, and uncertainties, the data synthesized by simulation models often does not match data from the system's real-world operation. We consider the broad research question of whether this model mismatch can be significantly reduced by generative artificial intelligence models (GAIMs). Unlike text- or image-processing, where generative models have attained recent successes, GAIM development for aerospace engineering applications must not only train with scarce operational data, but their outputs must also satisfy governing equations based on natural laws, e.g., conservation laws. The scope of this paper primarily focuses on two case studies of optimally controlled systems that are commonly understood and employed in aircraft guidance, namely: minimum-time navigation in a wind field and minimum-exposure navigation in a threat field. We report GAIMs that are trained with a relatively small set, of the order of a few hundred, of examples and with underlying governing equations. By focusing on optimally controlled systems, we formulate training loss functions based on invariance of the Hamiltonian function along system trajectories. We investigate three GAIM architectures, namely: the generative adversarial network (GAN) and two variants of the variational autoencoder (VAE). We provide architectural details and thorough performance analyses of these models. The main finding is that our new models, especially the VAE-based models, are able to synthesize data that satisfy the governing equations and are statistically similar to the training data despite small volumes of training data.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

However, such emergent behaviors remain unregulated and uncontrolled, often resulting in overthinking, where the model continues generating redundant reasoning content even after reaching reliable conclusions. This leads to excessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical deployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory mechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their reasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To address this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA), which explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and control components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control strategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction mechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and delegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling the construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a structured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised fine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial meta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment Policy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control behavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.

In this framework models work on ongoing token sequences with the current task being determined by stochastically interspersed control tokens. We show that standard transformers cannot solve a basic task switching reference model based on finite domain arithmetics which contains subtasks dedicated to increment / addition / reverse copy / context (IARC).

Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is rejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be discarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we propose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a 'query-and-correct' paradigm. Specifically, CARD decouples drafting and verification: the draft model generates candidate tokens to populate a shared cache, while the target model concurrently rectifies the draft model's generation direction. This effectively enables the target model to perform inference at speed approaching that of the draft model. Our approach achieves up to 4.83 speedup over vanilla decoding without requiring fine-tuning of either the draft or target models.

Specifically, given a monocular video, 4DVD first predicts the dense view content of its layout with superior cross-view and temporal consistency. Based on the produced layout priors, a structure-aware spatio-temporal generation branch is developed, combining these coarse structural priors with the exquisite appearance content of input monocular video to generate final high-quality dense-view videos. Benefit from this, explicit 4D representation~(such as 4D Gaussian) can be optimized accurately, enabling wider practical application.

Existing PFL methods typically face a significant challenge due to the ubiquitous data heterogeneity (i.e., non-IID data) across clients, which severely hinders convergence and degrades performance. We identify that the root issue lies in the long-standing reliance on gradient-based updates, which are inherently sensitive to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue and bridge the research gap, in this paper, we propose a Heterogeneity-invariant Personalized Federated learning scheme, named FedHiP, through analytical (i.e., closed-form) solutions to avoid gradient-based updates. Specifically, we exploit the trend of self-supervised pre-training, leveraging a foundation model as a frozen backbone for gradient-free feature extraction. Following the feature extractor, we further develop an analytic classifier for gradient-free training. To support both collective generalization and individual personalization, our FedHiP scheme incorporates three phases: analytic local training, analytic global aggregation, and analytic local personalization. The closed-form solutions of our FedHiP scheme enable its ideal property of heterogeneity invariance, meaning that each personalized model remains identical regardless of how non-IID the data are distributed across all other clients.

While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue that existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in incomplete erasure due to \"non-zero alignment residual\", especially when text prompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality degradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers. To address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is designed for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall generative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict zero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect alignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete erasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that gradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from shallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes diminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving generative quality.

Nevertheless, most existing methods that combine LLMs with KGs treat reasoning and knowledge updating as separate processes, resulting in suboptimal utilization of new information and hindering real-time updates. In this work, we propose TRAIL: a novel, unified framework for Thinking, Reasoning, And Incremental Learning that couples joint inference and dynamic KG refinement with large language models.

While interventions reduce gas demand on average (by as much as 19 percent), low energy burden groups achieve substantial savings, whereas those experiencing high energy burdens see little to no reduction. This pattern reflects a behaviourally-driven mechanism: households constrained by high costs-to-income ratios (e.g. more than 0.1) reallocate savings toward improved thermal comfort rather than lowering consumption.

We then examine methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and self-evolution.

Deterministically solving this transport problem at a sufficient resolution can however be prohibitively expensive, especially due to highly forward peaked scattering of the protons. We propose using a model order reduction approach, the dynamical low-rank approximation (DLRA), which evolves the solution on the manifold of low-rank matrices in (pseudo-)time. For this, we compare a collided-uncollided split of the linear Boltzmann equation and its Fokker-Planck approximation. We treat the uncollided part using a ray-tracer and combine high-order phase space discretizations and a mixture model for materials with DLRA for the collided equation. Our method reproduces the results of a full-rank reference code at significantly lower rank, and thus computational cost and memory, and further makes computations feasible at much higher resolutions. At higher resolutions, we also achieve good accuracy with respect to TOPAS MC in homogeneous as well as heterogeneous materials.

To address these issues, we propose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR.

Freeman", "subjects": "Machine Learning (cs.LG) ; Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)", "abstract": "A common use of machine learning (ML) models is predicting the class of a sample. Object detection is an extension of classification that includes localization of the object via a bounding box within the sample. Classification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by counting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the ground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as equivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy with a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or operator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure exists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a given prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground truth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions instead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of misclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in complexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class labels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The scoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees that represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors discouraged. Results demonstrate that these metrics capture errors with finer granularity and the scoring trees enable tuning. This work demonstrates an approach to evaluating ML performance that ranks models not only by how many errors are made but by the kind or impact of errors.

Causal representations of interventional image pairs, have the property that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the intervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state. While most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the variables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on representations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an effective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to focus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically, we propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding that is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal variables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is capable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any additional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate that Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings, significantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

We propose that a different and more substantiated framing of the problem could help to find more productive approaches. In the first part of the paper we report on a case study: a qualitative review on papers published in the ACL anthologies 2022 on discriminatory behavior of NLP systems. We find that the field (i) still has a strong focus on a technological fix of algorithmic discrimination, and (ii) is struggling with a firm grounding of their ethical or normative vocabulary. Furthermore, this vocabulary is very limited, focusing mostly on the terms \"harm\" and \"bias\". In the second part of the paper we argue that addressing the latter problems might help with the former. The understanding of algorithmic discrimination as a technological problem is reflected in and reproduced by the vocabulary in use. The notions of \"harm\" and \"bias\" implicate a narrow framing of the issue of discrimination as one of the system-user interface. We argue that instead of \"harm\" the debate should make \"injustice\" the key notion. This would force us to understand the problem of algorithmic discrimination as a systemic problem. Thereby, it would broaden our perspective on the complex interactions that make NLP technology participate in discrimination. With that gain in perspective we can consider new angles for solutions.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

However, traffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy constraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for traffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on designing communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information from other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such approaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting transmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume of traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical, making the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address this challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for federated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP). Unlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client communication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate predictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop Fed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to process its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information loss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI significantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process, and achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy regulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and federated settings.

Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting style signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the model's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer correctness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse. We attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions in certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that preserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates the style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation space via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables independent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing interference. By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each subspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to maintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness.

In these missions, robots must explore and map hazards while minimizing the risk of failure due to environmental threats or hardware limitations. We introduce a behavior-adaptive, information-theoretic planning framework for multi-robot teams grounded in the concept of Behavioral Entropy (BE), that generalizes Shannon entropy (SE) to capture diverse human-like uncertainty evaluations. Building on this formulation, we propose the Behavior-Adaptive Path Planning (BAPP) framework, which modulates information gathering strategies via a tunable risk-sensitivity parameter, and present two planning algorithms: BAPP-TID for intelligent triggering of high-fidelity robots, and BAPP-SIG for safe deployment under high risk. We provide theoretical insights on the informativeness of the proposed BAPP framework and validate its effectiveness through both single-robot and multi-robot simulations. Our results show that the BAPP stack consistently outperforms Shannon-based and random strategies: BAPP-TID accelerates entropy reduction, while BAPP-SIG improves robot survivability with minimal loss in information gain. In multi-agent deployments, BAPP scales effectively through spatial partitioning, mobile base relocation, and role-aware heterogeneity.

This study proposes a self-supervised domain adaptation framework for robust concrete damage classification using coda wave signals. To support this framework, an advanced virtual testing platform is developed, combining multiscale modeling of concrete degradation with ultrasonic wave propagation simulations. This setup enables the generation of large-scale labeled synthetic data under controlled conditions, reducing the dependency on costly and time-consuming experimental labeling. However, neural networks trained solely on synthetic data often suffer from degraded performance when applied to experimental data due to domain shifts. To bridge this domain gap, the proposed framework integrates domain adversarial training, minimum class confusion loss, and the Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) strategy. These components work jointly to facilitate effective knowledge transfer from the labeled simulation domain to the unlabeled experimental domain, achieving accurate and reliable damage classification in concrete. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves notable performance improvements, reaching an accuracy of 0.7762 and a macro F1 score of 0.7713, outperforming both the plain 1D CNN baseline and six representative domain adaptation techniques.

Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the model to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are streaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient to store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to store recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating whether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target event. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain long-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an event-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals that model event-level information with various durations. To preserve historically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event memory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent and long-term information.

However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality in real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{OMFA} (\\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition garments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing garments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target person (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel poses-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built upon a novel \\emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise and denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment, the person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient bidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely mask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input, making it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose try-on from just one image.

This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of training data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which consists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs with certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we find that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage their training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during training. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often incorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand this issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components, revealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling (LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and lightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via training bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between ground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias and adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only updates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\\% of the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both discriminative and generative tasks.

While effective, it remains unclear whether their gains stem from true multimodal understanding or increased model complexity. This work investigates the role of multimodal item embeddings, emphasizing the semantic informativeness of the representations. Initial experiments reveal that embeddings from standard extractors (e.g., ResNet50, Sentence-Bert) enhance performance, but rely on modality-specific encoders and ad hoc fusion strategies that lack control over cross-modal alignment. To overcome these limitations, we leverage Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multimodal-by-design embeddings via structured prompts. This approach yields semantically aligned representations without requiring any fusion. Experiments across multiple settings show notable performance improvements.

When such descriptions are incorporated as side content into recommender systems, they improve recommendation performance, empirically validating the semantic depth and alignment encoded within LVLMs outputs.

While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural grounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare, compositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual patterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale domain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Knowledge to Sight (K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by decomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as shape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from domain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which guide region-text alignment during training.

Inspired by dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers - and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA), low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT), MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance.

We discover that graph structures provide more consistent cross-domain information compared to node features and graph labels. However, traditional GFMs primarily focus on transferring node features from various domains into a unified representation space but often lack structural cross-domain generalization. To address this, we introduce GraphProp, which emphasizes structural generalization. The training process of GraphProp consists of two main phases. First, we train a structural GFM by predicting graph invariants. Since graph invariants are properties of graphs that depend only on the abstract structure, not on particular labellings or drawings of the graph, this structural GFM has a strong ability to capture the abstract structural information and provide discriminative graph representations comparable across diverse domains. In the second phase, we use the representations given by the structural GFM as positional encodings to train a comprehensive GFM. This phase utilizes domain-specific node attributes and graph labels to further improve cross-domain node feature generalization.

Physics-informed neural networks were investigated as a promising tool to reconstruct internal process states from experimental data, enabling model-based and non-invasive quality assessment in aluminum spot welding. A major challenge is the integration of real-world data into the network due to competing optimization objectives. To address this, we introduce two novel training strategies. First, experimental losses for dynamic displacement and nugget diameter are progressively included using a fading-in function to prevent excessive optimization conflicts. We also implement a custom learning rate scheduler and early stopping based on a rolling window to counteract premature reduction due to increased loss magnitudes. Second, we introduce a conditional update of temperature-dependent material parameters via a look-up table, activated only after a loss threshold is reached to ensure physically meaningful temperatures. An axially symmetric two-dimensional model was selected to represent the welding process accurately while maintaining computational efficiency. To reduce computational burden, the training strategies and model components were first systematically evaluated in one dimension, enabling controlled analysis of loss design and contact models.

In this paper, we study degree assortativity both in real-world networks and in several generative models for networks with heavy-tailed degree distribution based on latent spaces. In particular, we study Chung-Lu Graphs and Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRGs). Previous research on assortativity has primarily focused on measuring the degree assortativity in real-world networks using the Pearson assortativity coefficient, despite reservations against this coefficient. We rigorously confirm these reservations by mathematically proving that the Pearson assortativity coefficient does not measure assortativity in any network with sufficiently heavy-tailed degree distributions, which is typical for real-world networks. Moreover, we find that other single-valued assortativity coefficients also do not sufficiently capture the wiring preferences of nodes, which often vary greatly by node degree. We therefore take a more fine-grained approach, analyzing a wide range of conditional and joint weight and degree distributions of connected nodes, both numerically in real-world networks and mathematically in the generative graph models. We provide several methods of visualizing the results. We show that the generative models are assortativity-neutral, while many real-world networks are not. Therefore, we also propose an extension of the GIRG model which retains the manifold desirable properties induced by the degree distribution and the latent space, but also exhibits tunable assortativity.

With the increasing availability of large-scale datasets, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely adopted to learn features directly from raw ear images, outperforming traditional hand-crafted methods. However, the effect of bilateral ear symmetry on the features learned by CNNs has received little attention in recent studies. In this paper, we investigate how bilateral ear symmetry influences the effectiveness of CNN-based ear recognition. To this end, we first develop an ear side classifier to automatically categorize ear images as either left or right. We then explore the impact of incorporating this side information during both training and test. Cross-dataset evaluations are conducted on five datasets. Our results suggest that treating left and right ears separately during training and testing can lead to notable performance improvements.

Recently, generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional retrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic generation. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained by their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from two critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking a coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement (i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity. To overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that learns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core innovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization process that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more uniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict hierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for each recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE incorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space overlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but also promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive utilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled IDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks validate HiD-VAE's superior performance against state-of-the-art methods.

Existing solutions rely on trusted third parties and risk asset loss, or use decentralized alternatives like atomic swaps, which suffer from grief attacks. Griefing occurs when a party prematurely exits, locking the counterparty's assets until a timelock expires. Hedged Atomic Swaps mitigate griefing by introducing a penalty premium; however, they increase the number of transactions from four (as in Tier Nolan's swap) to six, which in turn introduces new griefing risks. Grief-Free (GF) Swap reduces this to five transactions by consolidating assets and premiums on a single chain. However, no existing protocol achieves grief-free asset exchange in just four transactions. This paper presents 4-Swap, the first cross-chain atomic swap protocol that is both grief-free and bribery-safe, while completing asset exchange in just four transactions. By combining the griefing premium and principal into a single transaction per chain, 4-Swap reduces on-chain transactions, leading to faster execution compared to previous grief-free solutions.

In this paper, we present HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation: DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements. HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the quality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction (e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model.

We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore, and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental evaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent tool calling generalization capabilities.

While some actors may do so to preserve their privacy, we show that this can inadvertently distort inequality metrics. As we show, when using inequality measures that satisfy literature's canonical set of desired properties, the presence of Sybils in an economy implies that it is impossible to properly measure the economy's inequality. Then, we present several classes of Sybil-proof measures that satisfy relaxed versions of the aforementioned desired properties, and, by fully characterizing them, we prove that the structure imposed restricts their ability to assess inequality at a fine-grained level.

However, continual fine-tuning LLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting, characterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and 2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously address both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample Replay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient anti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices under GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced activation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin (TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning. We are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general replay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general capabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks. Indeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled experiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies under the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via KL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses.

To address this limitation, we propose ANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under such perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by fusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered to form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt tokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper layers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware visual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype (NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally, ANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by computing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard cross-entropy and sim loss. Experiments across 11 benchmarks demonstrate that ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning approaches, achieving superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization to novel categories.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

In this paper, we argue that recent advances in hardware (e.g., larger GPU memory, faster interconnect and IO, and declining cost) and software (e.g., composable data systems and mature libraries) have removed the key barriers that have limited the wider adoption of GPU data analytics. We present Sirius, a prototype open-source GPU-native SQL engine that offers drop-in acceleration for diverse data systems. Sirius treats GPU as the primary engine and leverages libraries like libcudf for high-performance relational operators. It provides drop-in acceleration for existing databases by leveraging the standard Substrait query representation, replacing the CPU engine without changing the user-facing interface. On TPC-H, Sirius achieves 7x speedup when integrated with DuckDB in a single node at the same hardware rental cost, and up to 12.5x speedup when integrated with Apache Doris in a distributed setting.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

BEV perception offers a top-down-view representation of the surrounding environment, making it crucial for 3D object detection, segmentation, and trajectory prediction tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on enhancing BEV encoders and task-specific heads, we address the underexplored potential of representation learning in BEV models. BEVCon introduces two contrastive learning modules: an instance feature contrast module for refining BEV features and a perspective view contrast module that enhances the image backbone. The dense contrastive learning designed on top of detection losses leads to improved feature representations across both the BEV encoder and the backbone. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that BEVCon achieves consistent performance gains, achieving up to +2.4% mAP improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of representation learning in BEV perception and offer a complementary avenue to conventional task-specific optimizations.", "comments": "", "project_url": ""}

However, it remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across multiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and dynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level occupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the spatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core designs: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical information and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and a memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the spatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our method significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D occupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between multi-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal inconsistency by 29%.", "comments": "Accepted to ICCV2025.
